# Exploring Regression WithÂ Statcast
An autoregression model using Statcast data to build a predictive wOBA and explore xwOBA and xwOBACON's role in a predictive model.

Using Statcast Expected models as a predictive metric has become somewhat of a baseball discourse fallacy that I wanted to explore. Here I wanted to test using three data points: wOBA, xwOBA, and xwOBACON, to create a Predicted wOBA using simple regression analysis (using past performance to explain future outcomes).
